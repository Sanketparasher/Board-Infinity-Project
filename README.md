# Board-Infinity-Project
I installed Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Node.js and installed various files in it for importing the required settigs.
I  created a local server and connected it to our application.
I thereby created a cluster on MongoDB and linked it to Express.js
I downloaded postman and used its get and post feature to take data from a user and connected the same to MongoDB to be shared
