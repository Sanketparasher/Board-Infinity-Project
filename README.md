# Board-Infinity-Project
I installed Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Node.js and installed various files in it for importing thvarious settings 
I creaed an app.js file that in which I installed Express and Mongoose
I made a Post.js file which included the PostSchema which was subsequently connected to MongoDB
A posts.js file was created to to establish a local host which had all the information like  task name, task description,creator duration, createdAt to be given by the user.
We created a cluster on mongoDB with the name testboy and used dot envelope file to hide the contents that we dont want to make public like our password 
I finally used postman to post all the data to our server which is to be entered by the user
